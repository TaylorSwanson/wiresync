# Wiresync (Abandonware)
CLI tool to Easily send files and folders over wifi

## Why use wiresync
Wiresync was created to dynamically watch changes to a directory and sync the
files over to a LAN device, even when the device's IP address has changed.

The inspiration comes from transferring Blender render frames to another machine
as they are created instead of using `scp` to send tarballs manually.

Primarily wiresync is for headless machines. Configure it and it does the rest.
